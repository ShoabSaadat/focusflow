- Accent color: Pale blue (#ADD8E6), adding a touch of tranquility.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to combine modernity with a hint of warmth, and ensure legibility for longer blocks of text.
- Use simple, pastel-colored emoji icons to represent tasks and categories.
- Clean, journal-like layout with generous white space to maintain a calm and friendly user interface.
- Subtle fade-in and fade-out animations for task transitions and timer alerts to avoid distracting the user.
